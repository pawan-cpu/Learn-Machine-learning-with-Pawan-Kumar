        "\n",
        "Python is an open-source programming language that can be used to create small or big applications of various types like web apps, stand-alone desktop apps, etc. Python is considered for creating various applications because:\n",
        "- Ease of syntax \n",
        "- Variety of framework and libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the wide application areas of Python are: \n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Web applications:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is considered a solid option for web development. This is because along with a lower learning curve and various frameworks, Python also offers server-side programming for the website. \n",
        "\n",
        "Server-side programming allows controlling the flow of data that travels to and from the server. It also helps in controlled access authentication of the users. It reassures the website's stability and security. The various frameworks are used to cover all these aspects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the dominating web development frameworks in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Django:** Django is frequently used because of pre-built main components of the website like authentication (sign in,  sign out), file management structure for uploading files, and URL routing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flask:** Flask is a micro-framework with little to no dependence on the other libraries. This makes the flask lightweight than Django. Therefore Flask has the disadvantage of lesser features than Django.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pyramid:** Pyramid is a general, open-source, web application development framework built in Python. It allows Python developers to create web applications with ease. It is a much lighter alternative to Django. It includes routing and authentication features, but most of the other requirements such as templating and database management will need external libraries. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are few more frameworks used frequently. Python also allows to detach the frameworks and build the server from scratch. The process, however, will be time-consuming while the frameworks help to expedite the development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, it is to be considered, while selecting frameworks, that feature-rich frameworks might not be suitable for all types of websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, Python web development is useful but only for backend development and not for the front-end as it does not take responsibility for the layout and appearance. HTML and CSS are used to create the visual parts of many websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the popular web applications built with Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Netflix\n",
        "* Google\n",
