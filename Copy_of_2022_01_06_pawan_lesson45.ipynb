        "\n",
        "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a design methodology used for developing large software. OOP allows us to break our problems into small units of work called objects and then we build functions around those objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows us to interact with our code in the same way as we interact with actual objects in the real world by creating classes. This enables us to create reusable code and remove unnecessary or redundant code. That is why this concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
        "\n",
        "The four concepts of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Inheritance\n",
        "*   Encapsulation\n",
        "*   Polymorphism\n",
        "*   Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Abstraction is more relevant and useful in other programming languages such as Java, C++ and C#. Hence, we will not cover them in Python. You will never need it in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To get started with object oriented programming we need to know the concept of a class and an object."

This was possible because the developers built the app using the Object-Oriented Programming approach. "
